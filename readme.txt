== Frequently Asked Questions ==

* Why is jQuery Tinytips not available in my language?

I speak German and English fluently, but unfortunately no other language well enough to do a translation.

Would you like to help? Translating the plugin is easy if you understand English and are fluent in another language.

* How do I translate jQuery Tinytips?

Take a look at the WordPress site and identify your langyage code:
http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_in_Your_Language


E.g. the language code for German is "de_DE".


Step 1) download POEdit (http://www.poedit.net/)


Step 2) download jQuery Colorbox (from your FTP or from http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/jquery-tinytips/)


Step 3) copy the file localization/jquery-tinytips-en_EN.po and rename it. (in this case jquery-tinytips-de_DE.po)


Step 4) open the file with POEdit.


Step 5) translate all strings. Things like "{total}" or "%1$s" mean that a value will be inserted later.


Step 5a) The string that says "English translation by Arne ...", this is where you put your name, website (or email) and your language in. ;-)


Step 5b) (optional) Go to POEdit -> Catalog -> Settings and enter your name, email, language code etc


Step 6) Save the file. Now you will see two files, jquery-tinytips-de_DE.po and jquery-tinytips-de_DE.mo.


Step 7) Upload your files to your FTP server into the jQuery Tinytips directory (usually /wp-content/plugins/jquery-tinytips/)


Step 8) When you are sure that all translations are working correctly, send the po-file to me and I will put it into the next jQuery Tinytips version.
